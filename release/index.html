  <h1>Back To The Future</h1>

  <p>Writer and <strong>producer</strong> Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited his parents in <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis" title="St. Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri">Missouri</a> after the release of <em><a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Used_Cars">Used Cars</a></em>. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class, who was someone he had nothing to do with. Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school, when in reality she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.</p>

  <p>Zemeckis and Gale set the story in 1955 because, they claimed, mathematically, a 17-year-old traveling to meet his parents at the same age meant traveling to that decade. The era also marked the rise of teenagers as an important cultural element, the birth of rock n' roll, and suburb expansion, which would flavor the story. Originally the time machine was a refrigerator and its user needed to use the power of an atomic explosion at the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_National_Security_Site">Nevada Test Site</a> to return home. Zemeckis was "concerned that kids would accidentally lock themselves in refrigerators", and found that it would be more convenient if the time machine were mobile. The DeLorean was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_saucer">flying saucer</a> believable. In addition the original climax was deemed too expensive by the executives of Universal and was simplified. Spielberg later used the omitted refrigerator and Nevada nuclear site elements in his film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The writers found it difficult to create a believable friendship between Marty and Brown before they created the giant guitar amplifier, and only resolved his <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex">Oedipal</a> relationship with his mother when they wrote the line "It's like I'm kissing my brother." Biff Tannen was named after Universal executive <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Tanen">Ned Tanen</a>, who behaved aggressively toward Zemeckis and Gale during a script meeting for <em><a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wanna_Hold_Your_Hand_(film)">I Wanna Hold Your Hand</a></em>.</p>

      <p>Now, remember. According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting. If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids. That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.</p>

  <h2>Facts</h2>
  <p>John Lithgow was first considered to play Dr. Emmett Brown but he was unavailable. Producer Neil Canton (Trespass, Get Carter) suggested Christopher Lloyd, who chose to play Doc over an off-Broadway stage role he'd also been offered at the same time. Lloyd based his portrayal of Brown on Albert Einstein and "...conductor Leopold Stokowski, with the hair that way, and the big, broad gestures. Doc Brown walks around like he's conducting the orchestra of the world."</p>

    "I'm sure in 1985 plutonium is in every corner drug store, but in 1955, its a little hard to come by! I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here".

  <p>The school in the film is Whittier High in California and is Richard M. Nixon's alma mater. James Tolkan's Mr. Strickland (Prince in the City, Underworld, "Leverage"), who appears in all three films, was described by Gale as "a joy to work with."</p>
  <p>In the opening sequence, all of Doc’s clocks read 7:53 (25 minutes slow) except for one clock. It is on the floor next to the case of plutonium and it reads 8:20.</p>
  <p>Singer/Songwriter Huey Lewis, who provided two songs (with the News) for the soundtrack, appears as the audition judge. It was Lewis' idea to reject the band for being too loud; it had actually happened to him. The singer said that if people saw him "dressed nerdy (in the brown suit) on MTV his career would be over."</p>
  <h2>DeLorean</h2>
  <p>The DeLorean DMC-12 (commonly referred to simply as The DeLorean as it was the only model ever produced by the company) is a sports car manufactured by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company for the American market in 1981–82. Featuring gull-wing doors with a fiberglass "underbody", to which non-structural brushed stainless steel panels are affixed, the car became iconic for its appearance as a modified time machine in the Back to the Future film trilogy</p>
  <figure class="easywyg-pull-center"><img src="http://e.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/coexist/article_feature/delorean-ev-main.jpg" data-original-width="3846"></figure>
  <p>Several special-edition DMC-12 cars have been produced over the years, and the car is most notably featured as the time machine in the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_(franchise)"><em>Back to the Future</em> film trilogy</a>. The PRV engines of the cars were dubbed over with recorded <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine">V8</a> sounds. Six DeLorean chassis were used during the production, along with one manufactured out of fiberglass for scenes where a full-size DeLorean was needed to "fly" on-screen; only three of the cars still exist, with one having been destroyed at the end of <em><a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_III">Back to the Future Part III</a></em>, two additional cars left to rot, and the fiberglass replica being torn apart for scrap. Universal Studios owns two of the remaining cars, occasionally putting them on display or using them for other productions, and the last resides in a private collection after having been extensively restored.</p>
